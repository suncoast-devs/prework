# Prework

Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting learning before the program is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our program, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.

### Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript is an key language to learn in creating web sites. We will be doing a deep dive into the language at the beginning of the program because it is easier for beginners to pick up and allows a solid foundation for learning other languages.

## Back end Focus

Next, let us continue our journey with  Ruby & .NET. These languages are used on servers to power your websites. During the course you will choose a back end language to study in more detail. Each language will cover the same topics, such basics of servers and working with databases, but through the lens of that language. Try both languages and see which one feels better to you. Ask your instructors if you want to know more differences.
